# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by year and country, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum.

## Prototypes

First, I studied the suicide concept, and then I reviewed several sources to learn which attributes are more important than others.

Here are my attempts to understand the suicide consent :

1)[Data set : Number with depression by country](https://vizhub.com/mnalk/fea0c634364d46ed8fd79d08eb72947c)
This data set help to understand how many people in each country have depression.

Sketch for dataset(Number with depression by country)was a process to creat ideas below. The methodology used is [five design sheet](http://fds.design/)

2)Suicide rates vs prevalence of depressive disorder rates

Does depressoin leads to suicide? What percentage?

3)Prevalence of depression by age

Which age group has more depression?

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can make images into links like this:

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
