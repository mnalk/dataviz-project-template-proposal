# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by year and country, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum.

## Prototypes

First, I studied the suicide concept, and then I reviewed several sources to learn which attributes are more important than others.

Here are my attempts to understand the suicide consent :

1)[Data set : Number with depression by country in vizhub](https://vizhub.com/mnalk/fea0c634364d46ed8fd79d08eb72947c)
This data set help to understand how many people in each country have depression.

Sketch for dataset(Number with depression by country)was a process to creat ideas below. The methodology used is [five design sheet](http://fds.design/)

2)[Data set : Suicide rates vs prevalence of depressive disorder rates in vizhub](https://vizhub.com/mnalk/701a3a02e67641209795feeeb26c1493)
This dataset help us to answer if depressoin leads to suicide? then what percentage?

3)[Data set : Prevalence of depression by age in vizhub](https://vizhub.com/mnalk/64d20bde9bfd4b83a84cdcc4c8fa00b8)
This dataset help us to answer Which age group has more depression?

Second, I looked to a more depth dataset with the same goal: why do some countries have more suicides than other countries and why?. Then I updated the dataset to include world development indicators: GDP (current US$) by country:1985 to 2016. Retrieved from [source](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/world-development-indicators#).

This indicator would help us to improve tasks and questions regarding suicide among countries. For example, if suicide is high in one country, we would like to know if this is related to low GDP for that specific country.[Readme](https://gist.github.com/mnalk/9774fb9b221cfad2d21c387ff2e417ca#file-readme-md),and [csv file](

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
